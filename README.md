# üß† E-Commerce Product Classification using Bag of Words (BoW) + Machine Learning

This project performs **multi-class text classification** on an **e-commerce dataset** to classify product categories using **Bag of Words (BoW)** and **Machine Learning**. The classification is done using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** model, with text preprocessed and vectorized into n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) for better performance.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas  
- joblib  
- spaCy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CountVectorizer (from scikit-learn)  
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (from scikit-learn)  
- Pipeline (from scikit-learn)

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset contains **product names** from various categories, which are classified into 4 categories:

- **Books**  
- **Clothing_Accessories**  
- **Electronics**  
- **Household**  

üìå The raw data was preprocessed in a separate notebook: `ecommerceDataset.ipynb`

### ‚ú® Preprocessing Steps with spaCy:
- Lemmatization  
- Stopword removal  
- Punctuation removal  
- Lowercasing  

Resulting in a clean dataset: `processed_ecommerceDataset.csv`, ready for model training.

## üìå Key Features

- **Bag of Words (BoW)** technique for text vectorization.
- Text preprocessed by removing stopwords and normalizing the product names.
- Multiple model attempts tested with different n-grams (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** used for classification.

---

## ‚úÖ Results & Observations

- Achieved **~95% accuracy** on the test data.
- **Unigrams + Bigrams (Attempt 2)** provided the best F1-Score of **0.9516**.
- The model was saved as a **`.pkl` file** for future use.
